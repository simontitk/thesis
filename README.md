# Thesis - Gaze3P analysis

## Project structure

`eyelink_raw`: data provided by the original paper, plus the events from the edf files extracted as ascii files (no changes in content, edfs ignored in git) 

`eyelink_data`: answers and images (ignored in git, available in the original dataset) and the scanpaths (generated by `ascextractor.py`)

`FINAL_RESULTS`: figures added to the final report

`src`:
- `kernels`: implementations of the kernels used in the project
- `scripts`: utility scripts for data extraction
- `__ALL_GRAPHS_<...>.ipynb` files: notebooks used for generating plots for the Appendix about all graphs / scanpaths 
- `<0...13>.ipynb` files: main analysis pipelines including AOI matching, generation of transition matrices / graphs, calculating kernel values, using these for MDS and KRR
- `_graphutils.py`: core analyis methods for graphs
- `_plotutils.py`: core plotting functions
- `dataloader.py`: abstraction over accessing different components of the dataset
